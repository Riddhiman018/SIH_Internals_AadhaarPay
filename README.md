# SIH_Internals_AadhaarPayt

# Description
--To create a Digital payment solution for Aadhaar card holders to update their aadhaar details like biometrics and demographics. This solves the problem of overcharging 
at Aadhaar enrollment centers where only nominal charges are required to do the necessary updations. So an end to end solution has been created by us so that government authorities, aadhaar holders and operators have a transparent transaction system where each transaction is logged including those done in cash. 

--Digital Payments are done using fingerprint based verification systems and is transferred directly to govt. accounts

--Cash transactions are done by verification code systems. Once the citizen selects the pay using cash system a unique cash txn code is generated which the citizen gives to the operator and . On verification of the code, the operator validates the transaction and completes updation.

--In case the operator(third party person/organization having government contracts offering aadhaar services) overcharges(charges higher than govt. fixed rates) they can be reported immediately using our report overcharging feature that immediately alerts govt. authorities.
